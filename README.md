Hashtag-Social

This project was created as part of the CSS Frameworks course assignment.
The goal was to build a responsive front-end for a social media application using Tailwind CSS installed through npm.

Project overview:

- index.html: authentication page with register and login forms, including HTML validation and a responsive layout.
- feed/index.html: feed page that displays posts, includes a search bar, and a create post form that saves posts in localStorage.
- profile/index.html: profile page with user information, followers/following, and a list of posts retrieved from localStorage.

Scripts:
npm run dev
npm run build

Learning outcomes:

- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS through npm
- Created a responsive design using utility classes
- Used HTML validation on forms
- Organized files and build scripts correctly
- Used localStorage for simple data handling

Delivered as an open Pull Request from css-frameworks branch to main.
